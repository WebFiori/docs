# Environment Variables

<meta name="description" content="A reference of all environment variables which are global in WebFiori Framework.">

## Introduction

The framework comes with a class which is only used to initialize environment variables. They can be accessed anywhere within the scope of the application. The class [Env](https://github.com/WebFiori/app/blob/main/app/config/Env.php), which will always exist inside application's folder, is used to initialize the values of environment variables. The developer can modify the values of variables in the class as needed to configure some of the settings of the framework. Also, the developer can modify the content of the class and create his own environment variables.

## Variables

The following table lists all environment variables and for what each one is used.

| `APP_DIR`                | The name of the directory at which application source code will live in. Default value is `app`. Developer can override the value if the constant inside the file [`public/index.php`](https://github.com/WebFiori/app/blob/main/public/index.php#L10)                                                                                                                                                                                          | (`string`)                                                     |

| `USE_HTTP`               | Sets the framework to use `http://` or `https://` for base URIs. The default behaviour of the framework is to use `https://`. But in some cases, there is a need for using `http://`. If this constant is set to true, the framework will use `http://` for base URI of the system. Default value is false.                                                                                                                                     | false (`boolean`)                                              |

| `LOAD_COMPOSER_PACKAGES` | This constant is used to tell the core if the application uses composer packages or not. If set to true, then composer packages will be loaded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | true (`boolean`)                                               |
| `CRON_THROUGH_HTTP`      | A constant which is used to enable or disable HTTP access to cron. If the constant value is set to true, the framework will add routes to the components which is used to allow access to cron control panel. The control panel is used to execute jobs and check execution status.                                                                                                                                                             | false `boolean`                                                |
| `NO_WWW`                 | This constant is used to redirect a URI with www to `non-www`. If this constant is defined and is set to true and a user tried to access a resource using a URI that contains `www` in the host part, the router will send a `301 - permanent redirect` HTTP response code and send the user to `non-www` host. For example, if a request is sent to `https://www.example.com/my-page`, it will be redirected to `https://example.com/my-page`. | false (`boolean`)                                              |
| `DATE_TIMEZONE`          | Define the timezone at which the system will operate in. The value of this constant is passed to the function `date_default_timezone_set()`. This one is used to fix some date and time related issues when the application is deployed in multiple servers. See http://php.net/manual/en/timezones.php for supported time zones. Change this as needed.                                                                                        | 'Asia/Riyadh' (`string`)                                       |
| `PHP_INT_MIN`            | Fallback for older php versions that does not support the constant `PHP_INT_MIN`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | (`double`)                                                     |
| `WF_VERBOSE`             | This constant is used to tell the framework if more information should be displayed if an exception is thrown or an error happens. The main aim of this constant is to hide some sensitive information from users if the system is in production environment. Note that the constant will have effect only if the framework is accessed through HTTP protocol. If used in CLI environment, everything will appear.                              | false (`boolean`)                                              |
| `WF_SESSION_STORAGE`     | A constant which holds the class name of sessions storage engine alongside its namespace.The value of this constant is used to configure session storage engine. For example, if the name of the class that represents storage engine is `MySessionStorage` and the class exist in the namespace `extras\util`, then the value of the constant should be `\extras\util\MySessionStorage`.                                                       | "\webfiori\framework\session\DefaultSessionStorage" (`string`) |

| `CLI_HTTP_HOST`          | Host name to use in case the system is executed through CLI. When the application is running through CLI, there is no actual host name. For this reason, the host is set to `127.0.0.1` by default. If this constant is defined, the host will be changed to the value of the constant. Default value of the constant is 'example.com'.                                                                                                         | 'example.com' (`string`)                                       |
| `DS`                     | Directory separator. This one is is used as a shorthand instead of using PHP constant `DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR`. The two will have the same value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | (`string`)                                                     |
| `WF_PATH_TO_REMOVE`      | An optional string which represents the path part of a URI. The part which is defined by this constant will be removed when constructing the path part of the `base` URL of web pages. This is useful for the cases where the application exist inside a folder which exist inside the document root of the server.                                                                                                                             | Not defined(`string`)                                          |
| `WF_PATH_TO_APPEND`      | An optional string which represents the path part of a URI. The part which is defined by this constant will be appended when constructing the path part of the `base` URL of web pages. This is useful for the cases where the application exist inside a folder which exist inside the document root of the server.                                                                                                                            | Not Defined(`string`)                                          |
| `JSON_PROP_STYLE`        | This constant is used to specify the global properties style which will be used by any `Json` instance. The constant can have one of the following values only: `snake`, `kebab`, `camel` and `none`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Not Defined(`string`)                                          |
| `SESSION_GC`             | The value of this variable is used to determine the time at which sessions will be cleared after in seconds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Not Defined (`int`)                                            |
