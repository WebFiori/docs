## Introduction

One of the things that might concern web developers is to offer thier web application or website in more than one display language. One traditional approach is to have each language variant of the website in different path. For example, the developer might have a URL similar to `https://example.com/en/home` for English version and `https://example.com/ar/home` fore Arabic variant.

Every class must extend the class [`Language`](https://webfiori.com/docs/webfiori/framework/i18n/Language) and must be part of the namespace `webfiori\framework\i18n`.
