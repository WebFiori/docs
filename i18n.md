## Introduction

One of the things that might concern web developers is to offer thier web application or website in more than one display language. One traditional approach is to have each language variant of the website in different path. For example, the developer might have a URL similar to `https://example.com/en/home` for English version and `https://example.com/ar/home` fore Arabic variant. 

In WebFiori framework, it is possible to have one URL which points to multiple variants. For example, `https://example.com/home` can point to an English or Arabic variant of the website. 

## Language Classes

Before having same page in more than one language, the developer must define his language variables. Language variables are defined using classes which exist in the folder `app/langs`. Each language class will have the name `LanguageXX` where `XX` represents [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) country code of the language. Every class must extend the class [`Language`](https://webfiori.com/docs/webfiori/framework/i18n/Language) and must be part of the namespace `webfiori\framework\i18n`.

By default, the framework has two language classes, the class [`LanguageAR`](https://webfiori.com/docs/webfiori/framework/i18n/LanguageAR) for Arabic language and [`LanguageEN`](https://webfiori.com/docs/webfiori/framework/i18n/LanguageEN) for English.

## Creating New Language Class

First step in creating new language class is to know its [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) code. Using that code, we create new class based on that code. Assuming that we would like to create a language class for `UK`. In this case, the name of the class will be `LanguageUK`. The location at which the developer can create the class at does not matter. What matters is that the class must be part of the namespace `webfiori/framework/i18n`. It is recommended to have language classes at the folder `app/langs`.

Once the class is created, then the developer must make the class extends the class [`Language`](https://webfiori.com/docs/webfiori/framework/i18n/Language). After extending the class, the developer must specifiy writing direction of the language and its code in the constructure.

``` php
namespace webfiori\framework\i18n;

use webfiori\framework\i18n\Language;

class LanguageUK extends Language {
    public function __construct() {
        parent::__construct('ltr', 'UK');
    }
}
```

We have just created new language class and it is possible to load it in our web application. 

## Adding Language Variables

Language variables are created in a way which is similar to having a directory. Inside the directory, you can have files and more directories. The variables represent the files in this case. The method [`Language::createDirectory()`](https://webfiori.com/docs/webfiori/framework/i18n/Language#createDirectory) can be used to create a directory and the method [`Language::set()`](https://webfiori.com/docs/webfiori/framework/i18n/Language#set) can be used to create a variable in a directory.

``` php 
namespace webfiori\framework\i18n;

use webfiori\framework\i18n\Language;

class LanguageUK extends Language {
    public function __construct() {
        parent::__construct('ltr', 'UK');
        
        $this->createDirectory('pages/home');
        $this->set('pages/home', 'page-title', 'Welcome to My Website');
    }
}
```

This approach can be used to create a single directory with a single variable. What if we would like to create multiple directories and variables? To achive this, the developer can use the method [`Language::createAndSet()`](https://webfiori.com/docs/webfiori/framework/i18n/Language#createAndSet).

``` php
namespace webfiori\framework\i18n;

use webfiori\framework\i18n\Language;

class LanguageUK extends Language {
    public function __construct() {
        parent::__construct('ltr', 'UK');
        
        $this->createAndSet('pages', [
            'home' => [
                'title' => 'Welcome to My WebSite',
                'description' => 'Home page.'
            ],
            'about' => [
                'title' => 'About Me',
                'description' => 'Information about the author of the website.'
            ]
        ]);
    }
}
```
This code will create a directory with name `pages/home` with two variables and a directory with name `pages/about` with also two variables.
