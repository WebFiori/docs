## Introduction

A common challenge for web developers is supporting multiple display languages for their web applications or websites. A traditional approach involves creating separate website paths for each language variant. For instance, a developer might use URLs like https://example.com/en/home for the English version and https://example.com/ar/home for the Arabic version.

WebFiori framework offers an alternative approach that utilizes a single URL to serve multiple language variants.

For example, https://example.com/home could dynamically render the content in English or Arabic based on user preferences or other factors.

## Language Classes

For applications requiring multiple languages, developers must define language variables. This is achieved by creating language classes within the `[APP_DIR]/langs` directory.

* **Language Class Naming Convention:**
    * Each language class follows the naming format `LangXX`, where `XX` represents the two-letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code for the language.
    * All language classes must inherit from the base class `Lang` and reside within the `[APP_DIR]\langs` namespace.

* **Default Language Classes:**
    * The framework automatically generates two language classes by default:
        * `LangAR` - Arabic
        * `LangEN` - English

## Creating New Language Class

First step in creating new language class is to know its [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) code. Using that code, we create new class based on that code. Assuming that we would like to create a language class for `UK`. In this case, the name of the class will be `LangUK`. The class should be created in `[APP_DIR]/langs`.

Once the class is created, then the developer must make the class extends the class [`Lang`](https://webfiori.com/docs/webfiori/framework/Lang). After extending the class, the developer must specify writing direction of the language and its code in the constructor.

``` php
namespace app\langs;

use webfiori\framework\Lang;

class LangUK extends Lang {
    public function __construct() {
        parent::__construct('ltr', 'UK');
    }
}
```

We have just created new language class and it is possible to load it in our web application. 

## Adding Language Variables

Language variables are created in a way which is similar to having a directory. Inside the directory, you can have files and more directories. The variables represent the files in this case. The method [`Lang::createDirectory()`](https://webfiori.com/docs/webfiori/framework/Lang#createDirectory) can be used to create a directory and the method [`Lang::set()`](https://webfiori.com/docs/webfiori/framework/Lang#set) can be used to create a variable in a directory.

``` php 
namespace app\langs;

use webfiori\framework\i18n\Lang;

class LangUK extends Lang {
    public function __construct() {
        parent::__construct('ltr', 'UK');
        
        $this->createDirectory('pages/home');
        $this->set('pages/home', 'page-title', 'Welcome to My Website');
    }
}
```

This approach can be used to create a single directory with a single variable. What if we would like to create multiple directories and variables? To achive this, the developer can use the method [`Lang::createAndSet()`](https://webfiori.com/docs/webfiori/framework/Lang#createAndSet).

``` php
namespace app\langs;

use webfiori\framework\Lang;

class LangUK extends Lang {
    public function __construct() {
        parent::__construct('ltr', 'UK');
        
        $this->createAndSet('pages', [
            'home' => [
                'title' => 'Welcome to My WebSite',
                'description' => 'Home page.'
            ],
            'about' => [
                'title' => 'About Me',
                'description' => 'Information about the author of the website.'
            ]
        ]);
        $this->createAndSet('apis', [
            'say-hi' => 'Hi!'
        ]);
    }
}
```
This code will create a directory with name `pages/home` with two variables and a directory with name `pages/about` with also two variables.

## Using Language Classes

After creating language classes and setting variables, they must be loaded for use in your APIs or web pages.

### Using Language in Web Pages

The class [`WebPage`](https://webfiori.com/docs/webfiori/framework/ui/WebPage) has a method which can be used to get specific language variable. The method is [`WebPage::get()`](https://webfiori.com/docs/webfiori/framework/ui/WebPage#get). The method accepts one parameter which is the path to language variable.

``` php
namespace app\pages;

use webfiori\framework\ui\WebPage;

class HomePage extends WebPage {
    public function __construct() {
        parent::__construct();
        
        $this->setTitle($this->get('pages/home/title'));
        $this->setDescription($this->get('pages/home/description'));
    }
}
```

By default, language of the page will be based on default website language. If `?lang=XX` parameter is set in the query string, page language will be based on it.

### Using Language in Web Services

Loading a translation in web services is performed directly using the class [`Lang`](https://webfiori.com/docs/webfiori/framework/Lang). It is possible to make the service send a response based on a language code by adding a `get` or `post` parameter with name `lang` or fall back to default language. The developer can use the static method `Lang::getLabel()` to get a language variable.

``` php
use webfiori\http\Request;
use webfiori\framework\WebFiori;
use webfiori\http\AbstractWebService;
use webfiori\framework\Lang;

class SampleService extends AbstractWebService {
    public function __construct() {
        parent::__construct('say-hello');
        $this->addRequestMethod('get');
    }
    
    public function processRequest() {
        
        $this->sendResponse(Lang::getLable('apis/say-hi'));
    }
}
```
