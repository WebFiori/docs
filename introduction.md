## What is WebFiori Framework

WebFiori framework is a mini web development framework which was built in top of PHP language. The framework comes with minimum features that a web developer might need to have a functional web application. Initially, the framework was developed as a generic template that can be used to only build static websites. But since the start of the project in 2017, it evolved into much more than a generic template.
