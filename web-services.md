Web services play important role when it comes to sending and receiving data in the web.

WebFiori framework provides the very basic level of utilities at which it can be used to implement web services that supports data filtering and validation. The library [RESTEasy](https://github.com/usernane/restEasy) is one of the core libraries of the framework that can be used to create RESTful APIs in simple manner.

> **Note:** This library can be included using composer by including this entry in the `require` part of the `composer.json` file: `"webfiori/rest-easy":"*"`.
